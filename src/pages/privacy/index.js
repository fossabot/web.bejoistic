Okay, this is an easy one. ðŸ˜‰

Your privacy is more important to me than metrics. The internet needs to know less about us, not more. Just because itâ€™s possible to track someone doesnâ€™t mean we should.

# Analytics

# Data

This site doesn't have a database (so no accounts either).

## Forms
I only collect and process data that you actively provide to me. Currently that is [Pageclip][forms] to parse form submissions on this site. They are send to Pageclip Forms and then send to my personal e-mail which is hosted on [Soverin][soverin].

### Embedded content
Pages on this site may include embedded content (e.g. videos, images). These websites may collect data about you, use cookies, embed additional third-party tracking, and monitor your interaction with that embedded content. You can use facebook container, uBlock origin and/or DuckDuckGo privacy essentials to automatically block these third-party requests.
