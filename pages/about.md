Hi! I'm Ahmad Ainul Rizki (@bejoistic), which you've probably already guessed from the header above. I like making stuff on the internet. I'm passionate about technology, privacy, time well spent, interfaces and building digital products.

> My approach is organized, systematic and inclusive. I embrace flexibility, modularity and am willing to learn but also expect to be wrong.

I am devoted to make technology (and coding) more human, fun and playful. I like to make things that I havenâ€™t made before, that's how I learn.

I travel to work from anywhere, bootstrap side projects into open startups and only own what fits in my backpack.

I care about software freedom and digital privacy, and I am a staunch advocate of the same. I try to use free alternatives to software, if they exist.

I live by these [10 principles](/principles).

**Projects**

I'm a big believer in [digital side projects][projects] and continuously creating. A lot of what I do is [open source][os].

I don't have a favorite programming language but in the last few years I've used JavaScript in many different occasions and I gotta say I really dig Next.js! When I code on the back-end instead my heart almost always tells me to use Rust & Ruby.

**Little Story**

I'm passionate about retrocomputing, when I get the chance I collect old computers from the 80s. I try to learn old programming languages and paradigms, imagining what life was like before `.js` took over the world. I'm also really fond of skeuomorphic design of 90s and early 2000s UIs.

In my free time I like to practice freestyle bmx and cycling around the streets of Pekanbaru on my [Sick Bike](bike). Being Indonesian such a great, hiking location I enjoy exploring the countryside and hike the amazing [Merapi mountains](merapi).
