*The Meta Engineer* is an individual who can see beyond an immediate need and solution, and therefore is more comprehensive or transcending.

They should be pragmatic and not idealistic.

Their contributions go beyond writing raw code or turning a spec into code.

They guide teams to conceive larger system design solutions.

They ask why and – if necessary – ask you to try harder.

They are mentors and empower individual ideas.

The Meta Engineer is not a title.
