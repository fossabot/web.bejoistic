## What is chaos?

Chaos is a word commonly used to denote a situation of total disorder or confusion. There is a chaotic situation when someone has lost the overview. In this sense, the word can be used in many ways, such as a very cluttered environment or a situation where one cannot understand each other at all. But what does this mean for our daily lives, how does this affect every move we make. Here I will discuss the workings of chaos in the four fundamental principles in science. Biology, chemistry, physics, and mathematics.

- #### Chaos in biology

Chaos in biology refers to the working system in our own seeable environment. How we move like humans and how that movement intertwines with nature around us.

From the trees that grow to the animals, we see on our morning commute. as nature tries to keep everything in balance by the implementation of complex biological proses such as the food chain. if this food chain gets disrupted by outside unnatural factors. this balance will be distorted and nature may possibly fall in chaos. in biology chaos means death. if the balance tips towards an unwanted side, the object it may concern falls into the deep dark pit of nothingness.

We as humans have very much so contributed towards this cause. because every forest we cut down and every mineral we mine has influences that we might not have anticipated. Removing the forrest means, animals can’t live in it, cant feed of it. so they migrate toward urban areas, to find shelter and food, which in many cases disrupts the daily processes that are our own. such as making sure the trash is all locked up, so animals can’t get to it. or having to watch the road better, because more animals walk upon it. but once all the kinks have been worked out and once we get used to the animals being in our presence, the balance of nature returns. or as the saying goes “nature finds a way”.

- #### Chaos in chemistry

In chemistry, chaos refers to the interaction between Molecules, much like as in biology, molecules want to be stable. With a stable interaction between the atoms and a stable number of electrons surrounding them to form a full “shell”, also knows as orbitals. but ones that electron field is uneven or broken, the molecule becomes unstable and the chaos increases. this chaos increases in the form of entropy.

Entropy is a state function that is often erroneously referred to as the ‘state of disorder’ of a system. Qualitatively, entropy is simply a measure of how much the energy of atoms and molecules become more spread out in a process and can be defined in terms of statistical probabilities of a system or in terms of the other thermodynamic quantities.

Entropy is also the subject of the Second and Third laws of thermodynamics, which describe the changes in the entropy of the universe with respect to the system and surroundings, and the entropy of substances, respectively. what this means is that the more molecules there is the more entropy there is, the more disorder in the universe, soo more chaos. as an example, if you dump a bucket full of bouncy balls on the floor. it is hard to keep track of, thus there is more entropy thus more chaos. but if you only throw one bouncy ball. you can keep your eye on it. thus requiring less energy to keep track of the ball, so having less entropy and thus less chaos.

Now you may think but why are there not fewer chemical reactions in the universe then. because fewer reactions would mean less chaos, right. well yes technically right, but less chaos might not always be such a good idea. because the universal systems of chemistry expect there to be chaos. this chaos is more in the sense of energy, as reactions need the energy to build up and break down molecules. if this energy would not be available all chemical reactions in the universe would stop. alongside many other things, this would mean that oxygen won’t be produced anymore for us to breathe, meaning the end of all life on earth. so a bit of chaos might not be so bad after all.

- #### Chaos in physics

Here is where it gets complicated because many laws of physics are created to avoid chaos, they are created to be the opposite of Chaos, calmness or unison if you may.

The definition of chaos in physics is the property of a complex system whose behaviour is so unpredictable as to appear random, owing to great sensitivity to small changes in conditions. a common example of this is the butterfly effect, as this states that small changes can have an enormous impact. the smallest of changes like the movement of the wing of a butterfly, cause the slightest difference in air pressure causing a change in the movement of clouds in Japan. causing it to form a hurricane in texas or the activation of a nuclear reaction which will start as a small collision between radioactive elements, quite quickly becomes the destruction of everything within a 20-kilometer radius. which will cause a lot of chaos and carnage. but as most of us know the universe is an intrigued system of millions of simultaneously moving parts.

All may it be you think string theory, general relativity or quantum mechanics explains the moving of the universe, one thing in all those theories is certain, they all lead to the idea that there is calm in the chaos of the universe. we as a species eager for there to be some sort of unison combined theory that explains everything in the universe itself. also known as the unified field theory, where all known fundamental forces of nature come together in one elegant formula, with each there own unit of expression. but this “theory of everything” seems to get further away and more unlikely the more we learn about the universe as a whole. but we do know one thing that does collide in all know laws of physics, that a universe is a chaotic place.

- #### Chaos in mathematics

Chaos in mathematics is a whole different ball game, as it doesn’t interact at all with our touchable world. Here chaos is a tool to bring understanding to the principles behind the forms of chaos we mentioned before. because true deterministic chaos is characterized by unpredictable, apparently random motion in a dynamical system completely described by a deterministic dynamic law.

The inability to predict the future behaviour of a chaotic system occurs because trajectories evolving from arbitrarily close initial conditions diverge. Chaos is universal as it may arise in any system governed by one of a class of quite common, suitable nonlinear dynamic laws. this field of study in mathematics is called chaos theory which focuses on the study of chaos and states of dynamical systems whose apparently random states of disorder and irregularities are often governed by deterministic laws that are highly sensitive to initial conditions.

Chaos theory is an interdisciplinary theory stating that, within the apparent randomness of chaotic complex systems, there are underlying patterns, interconnectedness, constant feedback loops, repetition, self-similarity, fractals, and self-organization. so an apartment sense of chaos has an underlying cause for set chaos, yet this cause might in many cases be rather difficult to distinguish. in the other fields mentioned above, chaos is an instrument of expression of a thing that has or will happen. chaos in mathematics is a way to explain the origin of the event of chaos and predict its coming future with a series of mathematical equations. but again one line comes forth in this field of study, the need to find an explanation or solution for a seemingly chaotic experience. because if we know how the chaos will behave, we can prepare ourselves for set chaos and it will be less of an impact on us as humans.

## So, what is it?

The expression of chaos comes in many shapes and sizes, we create it by our own cause, it forms us in our daily lives, we move through it as the universe is made of it and we wish to predict it’s outcome of expression. yet we will never be able to control it or to steer it in our direction. because if we remove chaos from the equation that is life. life as we know it will stop. energy won’t be able to flow freely throughout the universe. the universe itself will collapse and we cease to exist. so embrace the chaos, but don’t let it determine your life, as it already embraces you.
