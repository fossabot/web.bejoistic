You are not a real engineer.
You are a creature with a terrible countenance
the stature of a man
and the head of a lion
with sixteen wings about you
white as fresh snow
hundreds of eyes
that flicker like torches
and dart in all directions
the belt at your waist is a serpent
your breath is the gathering of stormclouds
your voice is the roar of the wind
the grass withers before your footsteps
and your writhing, ponderous tongue
black as the abyss
brings apocalypse upon everything it touches

We regret to inform you
we will not be offering you the role at this time –
we’re looking for somebody more technical
